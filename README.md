# Soulhacker
For tracking Xenoblade Chronicles 3's Soulhacker class.

Changes will be saved locally to browser so navigating away from the site will not reset data. Clicking on some of the column titles will sort the data in ascending, then descending order on toggle. Refreshing the page will reset the order, but not the data. 

Created using some very simple code and self-made JSON data. I am not a frontend developer, nor a UI designer.
